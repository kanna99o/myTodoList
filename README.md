My Todo List app

I did this app just for the sake of learning the MEAN stack. Besides the main components od the stack I used:

- Webpack: to bundle the dependencies in the front-end and generate an static filter

- mongoose: to connect Mongodb to NodeJS

- nodemon: to restart the web server after any modification.

- Ng Inspector: to debug the front-end

- IronNode: to Debug the Back-end

- body-parser: to parse the body of the POST and PUT requests
